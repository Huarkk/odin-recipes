                <li>Pickled ginger and/or rakkyo (pickled Japanese scallion), for serving</li>

            </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>For the Curry Spice Blend: In a spice grinder, combine coriander, cumin, fenugreek, cardamom, black peppercorns, fennel, cinnamon, cloves, star anise, and orange peel (if using) and grind to a fine powder. Empty into a small bowl and combine with turmeric, chili powder, and nutmeg, then set aside.</li>
            <li>For the Stew: Season chicken all over with salt and pepper. In a large Dutch oven, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add chicken and cook, turning, until browned on both sides, about 6 minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate and set aside.</li>
            <li>Add onion to Dutch oven, lower heat to medium-low, and cook, stirring, until golden, about 10 minutes. Add carrots and cook for 4 minutes. Add chicken stock and dashi and bring to a simmer over high heat; reduce heat to maintain a simmer.</li>
            <li>Cut up chicken into bite-size pieces and add back to pot, along with any accumulated juices. Add potatoes and apple and cook at a gentle simmer until potatoes are tender and carrots can easily be pierced with a fork, about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan, melt butter over medium heat until foaming. Stir in flour and cook, stirring, until roux is a deep caramel brown, about 20 minutes. Stir in ginger and 3 tablespoons (25g) curry spice blend and cook for 1 minute. Remove from heat and let cool slightly.</li>
            <li>Scrape roux into stew pot, stir well, and simmer until broth has thickened. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in peas, if using, and cook until heated through.</li>
            <li>Serve curry with cooked rice and pickled ginger and/or rakkyo.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Notes</h2>
            <p> If you have cardamom pods, toast the pods first, then crack them to remove the seeds.

                You can dry orange peels on a baking sheet in an oven set to its lowest setting; check them frequently, and remove when dehydrated.
                
                If you don't have dashi, you can use the same volume of additional chicken stock to replace it. </p>
